# Password Generator JaveScript

## Description

This challenge assignment demonstrates JavaScript understanding and abilities. I started out with some starter code, and had to build on it to have a fully functioning Password Generator. This assignment really focused on JavaScript skills, with naming variables, writing and calling functions, and writing if (and if/else) statements. I didn't face too many challenges with this assignment, but sometimes mixed up variables and objects when trying to write the correct function. Overall, this assignment helped deepen my understanding of basic JavaScript that I'm excited to expand on in the near future.
